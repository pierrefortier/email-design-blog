If you've ever had to design an HTML email, you know what I'm talking about. It can often feel maddening to create and test emails when starting out, especially if you're already familiar with HTML and CSS. Most of the handy layout tricks we've come to enjoy in the past two decades of front-end design simply don't work or are very poorly supported in the world of email. The truth is, when it comes to email, you need to design like it's 1999.

I've been creating and maintaining email templates for my day job at The Ohio State University for a few years now, and I've discovered a lot of tricks and tools along the way to making better emails. My aim with this blog is to hopefully shed some light into the dark void of email design. I've done a lot of research and it can be frustrating to try and find a straightforward answer to many common issues. 

Despite its many flaws email remains a pillar of online communication and will likely be around for a long time. So let's try and make it easier for each other.
